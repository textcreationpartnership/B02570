            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of Captain JOHN KEY, late of the Lord STRATHNAVERS
Regiment.</head>
            <p>HE Raiſed his Company with great Charge, and never had any
Allowance for it.</p>
            <p>The Lieutenant Colonel oblig'd all the Captains, in the year
1694. to furniſh their Companies with Breeches, Shirts, and Cravats, to
ſupply the Defects of the Mounting ſent by the Colonel; which charge the
Colonel would never allow to the ſaid Captain.</p>
            <p>That for Argueing this matter with the Colonel, and
inſiſting for him to follow the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Dated <hi>May</hi> 30.
1690. (about the Clothing of Regiments) the ſaid Captain was put under
Confinement, and continued ſo for 21 days, till he was Releaſed by a Court
Martial.</p>
            <p>That the Captain having, at the Requeſt of the reſt of the
Captains, drawn a Paper of Objections againſt an Accompt given in by the
Colonel, fell thereby further under his diſpleaſure, and had all the
Hardſhips which the Colonel could contrive put upon him.</p>
            <p>That afterwards the Colonel propoſed, to ſubmit the
Differences of Accompts with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Arbitration, at <hi>Bruges,</hi>
and ſigned a Bond for that effect.</p>
            <p>That afterwards he retracted, and upon pretence of an Alarm,
commanded the ſaid Captain to his Poſt at the Camp at <hi>Newport,</hi> but
came not up himſelf.</p>
            <p>That the Captain obeyed, but finding no Alarm, he acquainted
Major General <hi>Fagell</hi> with the uſage he met with.</p>
            <p>That when the Colonel arrived, the Captain was put under
Confinement, becauſe he would not acknowledge he had done amiſs, in
acquainting the ſaid Major General with his Caſe.</p>
            <p>That his Subſiſtance was immediately ſtopt (which is
contrary to all Military Laws and Cuſtoms) and he never had any ſince.</p>
            <p>That he was neceſſitated, after long Application otherways,
to demand a Court Martial.</p>
            <p>That the ſame after a long delay was granted.</p>
            <p>That after the ſame was granted, and the Captain come to
<hi>Bruges,</hi> the Colonel confined him again, without the leaſt
Provocation, to hinder him (no doubt) from acceſs, to the Prince of
<hi>Vandement,</hi> and other Generals.</p>
            <p>That the next Day he ſent an Officer, commanding the Captain
to Return back to his Camp (after he was ſent for to <hi>Brages</hi> by the
Prince of <hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Order) and there to remain in Arreſt; which
Order was countermanded by the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Captain preſſed hard for the Court Martial to
ſit, but it was delayed 10 days lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which he ſuppoſes to be by his
Colonels Procurement.</p>
            <p>That the Captain could not obtain the Copy of any Complaint unto
which he was to Anſwer, altho the Princ of <hi>Vaudemont</hi> ordered it to
be given to him long before the ſitting of the Court Martial.</p>
            <p>That when the Court met, it conſiſted all of Field Officers,
nor could the Captain prevail to have any of his own ſtation to be a Member
thereof; which is contrary to Law, Equity, and the Cuſtoms of other
Nations.</p>
            <p>That when the charge was made before the Court, it conſiſted
of the following Articles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Captain had never heard, till they were
ſpoke by his Colonel at the Court Martial Board, and were as follows; </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Captain</hi> Key <hi>had, without acquainting the
Officer Commanding the Regiment, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to General</hi> Fagell <hi>for a
Foreloofe to return to</hi> Bruges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Captain</hi> Key <hi>had Reflected on his Colonels
Honour, by ſaying, That he was ſent from</hi> Bruges <hi>to the Camp by a
Sham or Trick.</hi> Unto both which the Captain made proper and reaſonable
Defences, but was Brow-beaten, and Interrupted often in doing thereof, and
threatned to be ſent to the Provoes; and then being commanded to withdraw, he
was called in and appointed to Prepare the State of Accompts with his Colonel,
within 10 days thereafter, to which time the Coure was Adjourn'd.</p>
            <p>Which being met according to Adjournment, they proceeded to take
the State of the Captain's Accompts into conſideration, but would not hear
him as to what he offered, telling him, they would oblige him to allow
ſeveral Articles, which were very unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>Then again commanding him to withdraw; And having called him in,
they told him, They had agreed upon a Sentence, but did not intimate what it
was, ſaying, They would ſend it to the Prince.</p>
            <p>This Sentence, whatever it was, was not Confirmed by His
Majeſty, or the Prince of <hi>Vaudement</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the Colonel a bout two Months thereafter,
ſurreptitiouſly Procured a Commiſſion to his Firſt Conſin, for the
Captains Company.</p>
            <p>By which Commiſſion the Captain's was made void: And to add
to his Misfortunes, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all thoſe Hardſhips, and his
Applications to all proper Perſons and Places to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed. he could
never yet obtain a Hearing, or any Relief, nor could ever certainly know what
the Sentence of the Court Martial was, concerning the Charge againſt him, or
his Accompts, by reaſon the ſame was never Recorded, having not been
Confirmed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Captain having had no Share of the Money ordered last
Seſſions of Parliament, towards Paying the Officers of the Scots Regiments,
nor having had half Pay allowed him, altho there be a conſiderable Sum oweing
him, for which he can obtain no account, he did Petition the Honorable Houſe
of</hi> Commons <hi>for Relief in the premiſſes; which Petition was
referred to the Committee to which the Petition of</hi> Nichols, <hi>and
others, was committed, which hath made no Report of the Captains Caſe; and
the Colonel keeping himſelf in</hi> Scotland, <hi>out of the reach of the
Engliſh Law, the Captain can find no Relief, unleſs the Honorable Houſe,
in compaſſion to his numerous Family, all born and living in</hi> London,
<hi>will be pleaſed, by a</hi> Clauſe <hi>in the Bill for Appointing
Commiſſioners to State the Accompts of the Army, Impower them alſo to
Examine and Determine of the Damages ſuſtained by the Hardſhips
above-mentioned.</hi>
